                       <p>Case results speak for themselves. I’ve helped my clients obtain millions of dollars in settlements and judgments.</p>
                       <p>If you’ve been injured or if you’ve suffered a loss, you need an experienced and successful attorney to fight for you and your loved ones.</p>
                       <p>High volume attorneys may promise you a quick settlement. But, they may not take the time to review your case as carefully as I will. You’ll get a quick settlement, but your case may be worth much more.</p>
                       <p>Don’t settle for less than you deserve.</p>
                       <p>Here are some recent case results & settlements:</p>
